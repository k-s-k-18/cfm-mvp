# Consumer Financial Management Tool
A personal finance management (CFM) iOS based application currently in early development.

In this phase, the focus is on building a financial dashboard by aggregating data from personal financial institutions (e.g., checking and savings accounts) and tagging transactions to help users organize and understand their spending behavior.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: SwiftUI
- Backend: TypeScript, Node.js, Express, DrizzleORM, Supabase

## Progress
- Set up basic authentication and backend scaffolding, including route and controller structure.
- Established connection with Supabase for storing and retrieving user information.
- Integrated the Plaid Development API to simulate financial account data and associate mock transactions with user profiles.

## Current Work in Progress (WIP)
- Finalizing the Authentication Workflow, including both UI/UX implementation in SwiftUI and full backend integration.
- Completing Plaid Integration with mock user data, including designing Plaid-compatible formatted JSON for transaction and account simulation.
